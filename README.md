Build a basic site showing "transport units" with scalability in mind (Think >100.000 transport units). 
Transport units should contain the following fields: Name: string Type: Enum (trailer, truck) 
* Task should be created using Laravel and Vue.js. 
* The site should contain two tabs. One to show trailers and one to show trucks. 
* It should be possible to create new transport units.
* It should be possible search for trucks or trailers.
* Tests for the different endpoints is appreciated.
